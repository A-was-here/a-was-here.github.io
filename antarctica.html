      <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>Speculation over the existence of a "southern land" was not confirmed until the early <time datetime="1820">1820s</time> when British and American commercial operators and British and Russian national expeditions began exploring the Antarctic Peninsula region and other areas south of the Antarctic Circle. Not until <time datetime="1840">1840</time> was it established that Antarctica was indeed a continent and not merely a group of islands or an area of ocean. Several exploration "firsts" were achieved in the early 20th century, but generally the area saw little human activity. </p>
        <p>Following World War II, however, the continent experienced an upsurge in scientific research. A number of countries have set up a range of year-round and seasonal stations, camps, and refuges to support scientific research in Antarctica. Seven have made territorial claims, but most countries do not recognize these claims. </p>
        <p>In order to form a legal framework for the activities of nations on the continent, an Antarctic Treaty was negotiated that neither denies nor gives recognition to existing territorial claims; signed in <time datetime="1959">1959</time>, it entered into force in <time datetime="1961">1961</time>.Â  Also relevant to Antarctic governance are the Environmental Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty and the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources.</p>

          <h4>Area</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>total: 14.2 million <abbr title="square kilometers">sq km</abbr></li>
              <li>land: 14.2 million sq km (285,000 sq km ice-free, 13.915 million sq km ice-covered (<abbr title="estimation">est.</abbr>))</li>
            </ul>
            <aside>note: fifth-largest continent, following Asia, Africa, North America, and South America, but larger than Australia and the subcontinent of Europe.</aside>
          <h4>Maritime claims</h4>
          <p>The following countries claim Exclusive Economic Zone rights or similar over 200 <abbr title="nautical miles">nm</abbr> extensions seaward from their continental claim:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Australia</li>
            <li>Argentina</li>
            <li>Chile</li>
          </ul>
          <p>However, these zones are not accepted by other countries.</p>

          <p>22 of 29 Antarctic Treaty consultative parties have made no claims to Antarctic territory (although Russia and the US have reserved the right to do so)</p>
          <h4>Natural hazards</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>katabatic (gravity-driven) winds blow coastward from the high interior</li>
            <li>frequent blizzards form near the foot of the plateau</li>
            <li>cyclonic storms form over the ocean and move clockwise along the coast</li>
            <li>volcanism on Deception Island and isolated areas of West Antarctica; other seismic activity rare and weak</li>
            <li>large icebergs may calve from ice shelf</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Current issues</h4>
          <p>The discovery of a large Antarctic ozone hole in the earth's stratosphere (the ozone layer) - first announced in <time datetime="1985">1985</time> - spurred the signing of the Montreal Protocol in <time datetime="1987">1987</time>, an international agreement phasing out the use of ozone-depleting chemicals. The ozone layer prevents most harmful wavelengths of ultra-violet light from passing through the earth's atmosphere. Ozone depletion has been shown to harm a variety of Antarctic marine plants and animals (plankton). In <time datetime="2016">2016</time>, a gradual trend toward "healing" of the ozone hole was reported. Since the <time datetime="1990">1990s</time>, satellites have shown accelerating ice loss driven by ocean change. Although considerable uncertainty remains, scientists are increasing our understanding and ability to model potential impacts of ice loss.</p>
          <h4>Climate</h4>
          <p>The coldest, windiest, and driest continent on Earth. Severe low temperatures vary with latitude, elevation, and distance from the ocean. Summers characterized by continuous daylight, while winters bring continous darkness. Persistent high pressure over the interior brings dry, subsiding air that results in very little cloud cover</p>
          <p>East Antarctica is colder than West Antarctica because of its higher elevation. Antarctic Peninsula has the most moderate climate; higher temperatures occur in January along the coast and average slightly below freezing.</p>
          <h4>Land use</h4>
          <p>agricultural land: 0% (<time datetime="2018">2018</time> est.)</p>
