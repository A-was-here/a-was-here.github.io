            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Many people turn to dietary supplements for management of Neuropsychiatric Conditions. Some fear side effects from prescription medication. Supplements are promoted as "natural", and therefore are perceived to cause less harsh effects. For others, barriers to treatment, including cost and stigma, cause them to turn to supplements as a more accessible and cost-effective treatment plan.</p>
            <p>How effective are these non-prescription supplements? Are they truly as harmless as they are perceived?</p>

          <section id="mag">
            <h3>Magnesium</h3>
            <p>United States Food and Nutrition Board recommends between 320 mg and 420 mg of magnesium for adults. However, most adults do not consume the daily recommended amount of magnesium. The decline in magnesium intake is thought to be attributed to increased processing of foods and mineral depletion of agricultural soil. Magnesium deficiency has been linked to a number of health conditions, including depression, migraines, anxiety, and insomnia.</p>
            <p>Magnesium is a mineral that is used in many processes in the human body, including blood pressure control, energy production, and development of bone structures. Because Magnesium regulates the transport of calcium and potassium ions across membranes, it helps maintain regular nerve and muscle conduction. Inside the brain, magnesium is thought to impact neuropsychiatric health by affecting the production and transport of neurotransmitters and therefore regulate connectivity between neurons.</p>
            <p>Magnesium has shown promise but also mixed results in clinical trials for neuropsychiatric disorders. A 2017 clinical trial indicated magnesium chloride may be effective in improving mild-to-moderate depression in adults. However, a 2016 study on post-partum women concluded that magnesium sulfate supplements did not significantly reduce post-partum depression and anxiety. However, the disparity in results could be explained by differences in the type of magnesium used. Not all magnesium supplements are created equal. Bioavailability and ability to cross the blood-brain barrier is dependent on the magnesium compound.

            The amino acid, 5-Hydroxytryptophan is a precursor to the neurotransmitter serotonin.
