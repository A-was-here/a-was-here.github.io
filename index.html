      <h2>Banana slicer story</h2>
        <p>So I ate a banana this morning and thought, "Wouldn't it be nice to slice this banana?" I looked at Amazon reviews of a banana slicer. It does exactly what you think it would do. The reviews were hilarious.</p>
      <h2>Facepalm. Please don't judge me</h2>
        <p>This probably sounds dumb, but I just realized html is limited to creating web pages.</p>
        <p>Say I want to make an automation consisting of the following steps:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Create a new document using Word/Excel/other app</li>
          <li>Name new document xyz</li>
          <li>Save new document in this folder </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Then html would be the wrong language for that kind of thing. Right? Over the break I was messing around with Apple script editor. I was able to do step 1, but couldn't figure out steps 2 and 3.</p>
      <h2>List and Table</h2>
        <p>Cute text faces include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>owo</li>
          <li>uwu</li>
          <li>OwO</li>
          <li>VwV</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Now here's a table:</p>
        <table>
           <thead>
             <tr>
               <th colspan="3">Data from nothing in particular</th>
             </tr>
           </thead>
           <tbody>
             <tr>
               <td></td>
               <td>yes</td>
               <td>no</td>
             </tr>
             <tr>
               <td>A</td>
               <td>1</td>
               <td>2</td>
             </tr>
             <tr>
               <td>B</td>
               <td>0</td>
               <td>3</td>
             </tr>
             <tr>
               <td>C</td>
               <td>1</td>
               <td>3</td>
             </tr>
           </tbody>
             <tfoot>
               <tr>
                 <th colspan="3"><small>This table looks awful without borders. I'm sad.</small></th>
               </tr>
             </tfoot>

        </table>

          <h3>Guy named Pie</h3>
          <p><small>March 2018</small></p>
          <p>There once was a guy named Pie.<br>
            Pie fell from the sky.<br>
            Pie's hair was green,<br>
            and once he was seen,<br>
            someone said he needs to die.</p>

            <p>"He’s cursed,” said the big-nosed Blair.<br>
            “Sign of the slick, green hair—<br>
            he’ll turn our aunts<br>
            into cactus plants<br>
            ’n’ sell them on that hill over there!”</p>

            <p>Pie was chased out of town.<br>
            Upon his face was a frown.<br>
            A shotgun fired<br>
            and Pie perspired.<br>
            He heard, “Hey Pie! Get down!”</p>

            <p>“You need to find a new place,”<br>
            said a guy with a shrunken face.<br>
            “Our town’s not far —<br>
            let’s go to the bar.<br>
            Your new home, soon, you’ll embrace”</p>

            <p>From so much shock, Pie went lame.<br>
            “How d’you know my name?<br>
            You’re creepy as hell!<br>
            And I’d prefer to just, well,<br>
            dye my hair color of flame.”</p>

            <p>Pie’s slick hair now looked red.<br>
            Nobody turned a head.<br>
            Pie thanked the guy<br>
            who lent the dye,<br>
            and then smiled going to bed.</p>

            <h3>Random stuff</h3>
            <p>Since I used one h3, I thought I should use another one. You know, to keep things balanced.</p>
