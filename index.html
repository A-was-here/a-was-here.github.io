            <h3>Introduction</h3>

            <p>Some people prefer to use dietary supplements for brain and mental health. Is that safe? How effective is that?</p>

            <p>In general, there are some pros and cons that apply to all over-the-counter dietary supplements:</p>
            <h4>Pros</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Accessible.</li>
                <li>May be more affordable.</li>
                <li>Less stigma</li>
                <li>May have fewer side effects.</li>
                <li>Percieved as more "natural".</li>
              </ul>
            <h4>Cons</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Unknown interactions.</li>
                <li>Lack of FDA regulation.</li>
                <li>May have misleading advertising.</li>
                <li>Lack of study.</li>
              </ul>

            <h3>Magnesium</h3>
            <p>Due to the rise in food processing, most adults in the US do not get enough magnesium from meals. This is a problem because magnesium plays an important role in many processes, including the health of muscles and nerves.
            </p>
            <p>Magnesium deficiency can lead to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Muscle cramps</li>
              <li>Anxiety</li>
              <li>Depression</li>
              <li>Insomnia</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Testing for magnesium levels can be difficult because a lot of the body's magnesium is stored in bones and not in the bloodstream. Therefore, a blood test may not be an accurate indicator of magnesium levels.</p>

            <p>Using over the counter magnesium supplements can be tricky. There are many forms of magnesium supplements, and each has different ability to be absorped by the human gut. For example:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Magnesium Oxide has very poor absorption rate and tends to have a laxative effect</li>
              <li>Magnesium Citrate has higher chance of absorption and crossing the blood brain barrier.</li>
              <li>Magnesium Glycinate is relatively new, but it shows promise of good absorption.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Magnesium supplements have few side effects. Generally, diarrhea is the worst that can happen if you ingest too much magnesium.</p>
