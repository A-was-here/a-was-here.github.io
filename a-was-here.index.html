      <h2>Um, hi. Idk what else to put here, so enjoy this poem I wrote.</h2>
        <h3>Pie</h3>
        <p>There once was a guy named Pie.<br>
          Pie fell from the sky.<br>
          Pie's hair was green,<br>
          and once he was seen,<br>
          someone said he needs to die.</p>

          <p>"He’s cursed,” said the big-nosed Blair.<br>
          “Sign of the slick, green hair—<br>
          he’ll turn our aunts<br>
          into cactus plants<br>
          ’n’ sell them on that hill over there!”</p>

          <p>Pie was chased out of town.<br>
          Upon his face was a frown.<br>
          A shotgun fired<br>
          and Pie perspired.<br>
          He heard, “Hey Pie! Get down!”</p>

          <p>“You need to find a new place,”<br>
          said a guy with a shrunken face.<br>
          “Our town’s not far —<br>
          let’s go to the bar.<br>
          Your new home, soon, you’ll embrace”</p>

          <p>From so much shock, Pie went lame.<br>
          “How d’you know my name?<br>
          You’re creepy as hell!<br>
          And I’d prefer to just, well,<br>
          dye my hair color of flame.”</p>

          <p>Pie’s slick hair now looked red.<br>
          Nobody turned a head.<br>
          Pie thanked the guy<br>
          who lent the dye,<br>
          and then smiled going to bed.</p>

      <h2>Banana slicer</h2>
        <p>Yeah, so I ate a banana this morning. I loooked at Amazon reviews of a banana slicer. It does exactly what you think it would do. The reviews were hilarious.</p>
