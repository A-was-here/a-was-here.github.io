    <h2>Stages of a soul-crushing essay</h2>
    <p>Stage one: You think you have a grand idea for your essay. It's a clever and original argument. It will be the best essay ever! A revolutionary masterpiece!</p>
    <p>Stage two: You write your idea on a page, go to sleep, and read it the next day. You are horrified. Who wrote this garbage? Oh right, it was yourself. Is your "grand idea" truly that great? You decide to wait. Collect your thoughts. Come back later when you’re more coherent.</p>
    <p>Stage three: Many days have passed. But every time you look at your essay, you are overcome with paralyzing anxiety. And so you delay some more, praying the muse will sing to you when the time comes.</p>
    <p>Stage four: You cannot delay anymore and force your garbled thoughts onto paper. You no longer remember your main point and start splattering the essay with lexical diarrhea. Your grand idea chokes to death in a sewage of meaningless words.</p>
    <p>Stage five: You approach the word requirement. Surely, the instructor won’t if notice you’re a few words short. Okay, more like 50 to 100 words short. You know you should proofread. Perhaps polish this one section a little more. No. No more. LET IT END! Submit.</p>
